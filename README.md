# NeuralNetwork

My own well-commented implementation of Feed-Forward Neural Network and Back Propagation algorithm on pure python with numpy.

Features: 
* Adoptive learning rate
* Matrixes operation to improve efficiency.
* Flexible activation-function (Abstract class to implement any function. Sigmoid and ReLU are built-in)
* Flexible loss-function (Abstract class to implement any function. MSE and LogLoss are built-in)
* Built-in cross-validation.

File NeuralInUse.ipynb contains an example of using the Neural Network. Maybe interesting for the ones who are styding NN.
